  abstract = {During the last few decades, China has accomplished unprecedented economic growth and has emerged as the second largest economy in the world. This ?economic miracle? has led hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, but has also come at a high cost. Environmental degradation and the impact of environmental pollution on health are nowadays issues of the greatest concern for the Chinese public and the government. The Routledge Handbook of Environmental Policy in China focuses on the environmental challenges of China?s rapidly growing economy and provides a comprehensive overview of the policies developed to address the environmental crisis. Leading international scholars and practitioners examine China?s environmental governance efforts from an interdisciplinary perspective. Divided into five parts, the handbook covers the following key issues: Part I: Development of Environmental Policy in China - Actors and Institutions Part II: Key issues and Strategies for Solution Part III: Policy Instruments and Enforcement Part IV: Related Policy Fields ? Conflicts and Synergies Part V: China?s Environmental Policy in the International Context This comprehensive handbook will be an invaluable resource to students and scholars of environmental policy and politics, development studies, Chinese studies, geography and international relations.},

  abstract = {This chapter analyzes the cases of Huawei’s CSR program and the Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology, a NGO organized by a group of companies, to explore the recent development of CSR in China. Three actors of central importance for recent trends are identified: the government, NGOs, and Chinese MNCs. An updated timeline is brought forward, which separates the introduction of CSR to China into a period of passive acceptance (1990s), learning and adoption (2000s), and active engagement (2010s). A promising trend is identified, with the limitation that second element of CSR, reducing the adverse effects of the company’s commercial activities, is not getting enough attention.},
