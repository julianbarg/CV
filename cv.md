<!-- Innerhalb dieses wissenschaftstheoretischen Selbstverständnisses bleibt aber den Soziologen allenfalls der Spielraum seiner Doppelrolle als Wissenschaftler und Staatsbürger: er kann die Aufgaben, die er soziologisch bearbeiten möchte, nach Gesichtspunkten politischer Relevanz auswählen, aber auf die wissenschaftliche Arbeit selbst kann dann eine solche staatsbürgerliche Vorentscheidung keinen Einfluß haben. --> 

> *[T]he sociologist has at most the leeway of his double role as scientist and citizen: He can select the tasks he wants to work on sociologically according to aspects of political relevance, but on the scientific work itself such a civic preliminary decision can then have no influence.*
